### This repo hosts code for DE/DS experiments done using [NYC TLC Taxi Trip Dataset](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and a [playground compitition]((https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration)) hosted by Kaggle.
These experiments are meant to demonstrate solving common use cases that come up while building a data platform and comparing tools such as DBT & Spark for implementing these use cases.

### For more details checkout my blog [Choosing the right tool while building your Data Platform: DBT vs. Spark (ByÂ Example)](https://medium.com/p/5c804714433e/edit).

### Current List of experiments -
1. Airport Insights: Comparing taxi pickups and dropoffs at JFK & LaGuardia airports.
2. Taxi trip duration prediction: Solutions for doing real time and batch predictions for taxi trips.
3. Visualisations: Visualising  NYC taxi trips on a map, creating charts for comparing cab traffic at airports and market share of services such as Uber & Lyft.
